Running the Examples
====================

All the examples assume your machine is running the ``docker`` daemon. To
run the ``docker`` daemon in the background, simply type:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo docker -d &

Now you can run Docker in client mode: by default all commands will be
forwarded to the ``docker`` daemon via a protected Unix socket, so you
must run as the ``root`` or via the ``sudo`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo docker help

Hello World
===========

.. include:: example_header.inc

This is the most basic example available for using Docker.

Download the base image which is named ``ubuntu``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Download an ubuntu image
    sudo docker pull ubuntu

Alternatively to the ``ubuntu`` image, you can select ``busybox``, a bare
minimal Linux system. The images are retrieved from the Docker
repository.


.. code-block:: bash

    sudo docker run ubuntu /bin/echo hello world

This command will run a simple ``echo`` command, that will echo ``hello world`` back to the console over standard out.

**Explanation:**

- **"sudo"** execute the following commands as user *root* 
- **"docker run"** run a command in a new container 
- **"ubuntu"** is the image we want to run the command inside of.
- **"/bin/echo"** is the command we want to run in the container
- **"hello world"** is the input for the echo command

Hello World Daemon
==================

.. include:: example_header.inc

And now for the most boring daemon ever written!

This example assumes you have Docker installed and the Ubuntu
image already imported with ``docker pull ubuntu``.  We will use the Ubuntu
image to run a simple hello world daemon that will just print hello
world to standard out every second. It will continue to do this until
we stop it.

**Steps:**

.. code-block:: bash

    CONTAINER_ID=$(sudo docker run -d ubuntu /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done")

We are going to run a simple hello world daemon in a new container
made from the ``ubuntu`` image.

- **"sudo docker run -d "** run a command in a new container. We pass "-d"
  so it runs as a daemon.
- **"ubuntu"** is the image we want to run the command inside of.
- **"/bin/sh -c"** is the command we want to run in the container
- **"while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"** is the mini
  script we want to run, that will just print hello world once a
  second until we stop it.
- **$CONTAINER_ID** the output of the run command will return a
  container id, we can use in future commands to see what is going on
  with this process.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo docker logs $CONTAINER_ID

Check the logs make sure it is working correctly.

- **"docker logs**" This will return the logs for a container
- **$CONTAINER_ID** The Id of the container we want the logs for.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo docker attach $CONTAINER_ID

Attach to the container to see the results in real-time.

- **"docker attach**" This will allow us to attach to a background
  process to see what is going on.
- **"-sig-proxy=true"** Proxify all received signal to the process
  (even in non-tty mode)
- **$CONTAINER_ID** The Id of the container we want to attach too.

Exit from the container attachment by pressing Control-C.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo docker ps

Check the process list to make sure it is running.

- **"docker ps"** this shows all running process managed by docker

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo docker stop $CONTAINER_ID

Stop the container, since we don't need it anymore.

- **"docker stop"** This stops a container
- **$CONTAINER_ID** The Id of the container we want to stop.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo docker ps

Make sure it is really stopped.
